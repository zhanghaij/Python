# Awesome Python Applications

<!-- NOTE: This file is automatically generated, see projects.yaml -->

As developers, we spend our days with code. But it's applications that
matter to the wider public. When building our own applications,
open-source Python applications are a gold mine of practical patterns
that we know work together. <!-- the x-y problem, at scale? -->

This document is a list of **{TOTAL_COUNT}** open-source Python applications arranged by
topic. If you have one to add or find some information missing,
[please let us know](https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications/issues)!

<!-- To see this list arranged by which operating systems they
support (and associated discussion), see Platforms, and to see the
list arranged by implementation approach used (and discussion
thereof), see Architectures. -->
